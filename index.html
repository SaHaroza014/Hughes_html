    <h2>1905. - 1976.</h2>
    <h3>Famous aviator and film maker</h3>
    <div style="font-size: large;">Howard Robard Hughes Jr. (December 24, 1905 – April 5, 1976) was an American business
        magnate, investor, record-setting pilot, engineer,
        film director, and philanthropist, known during his lifetime as one of the most
        influential and financially successful individuals in the world. He first
        became prominent as a film producer, and then as an important figure in the
        aviation industry. Later in life, he became known for his eccentric behavior
        and reclusive lifestyle—oddities that were caused in part by his worsening
        obsessive-compulsive disorder, chronic pain from a near-fatal plane
        crash, and increasing deafness.</div>
